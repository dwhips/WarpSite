            Thanks for checking out the website! I hope you have enjoyed the fruits and weeds of my labor. I have a background in 
            computer science which has exposed me to various technologies which I enjoy learning more about in my free time. 
            But as any programmer knows, ideas are many and completed projects are few. That's where the site came to life. 
            <br><br>
            Being able to have a collection of small projects has helped motivate me to continue learning web development as a hobby 
            and to view my progress as I grow. The small commitment of adding a new page is much less daunting than learning an entirely
             new language or IDE which would often deter me from starting new projects. Plus it is really fun to share this with friends; 
             not as easy to do with unfinished unity projects! I would highly recommend this flow if you are interested in learning web dev or find yourself getting burnt out from coding.
            <br><br>
            I also get excited about very useless projects that make you think “Why?”. As this site grows I hope to introduce many random
             and pointless ideas that stretch my creativity and technical skills. 
            <br><br>
            Welcome to Whipple was made with the basics! Just HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. If you want to look into the code, you can
