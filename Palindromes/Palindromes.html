    <p> <a href=https://www.timeanddate.com/date/palindrome-day.html> link to site </a> have fun gui for finding next palindrome date</p>

    <p>It's time to explore palindromes! 
        Don't nod, palindromes are a word, phrase, number or sequence of language that read the same forwards and backwards.
    Try the next few examples</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><b>Mom</b></li>
        <li><b>Kayak</b></li>
        <li><b>Top spot</b></li>
        <li><b>Never odd or even</b></li>
        <li><b>Red rum, sir, is murder</b></li>
    </ul>

    <p>As we have seen, palindromes can form words and sentences of varying difficulty. It can also be seen in interesting ways in math. 
        For instance see what happens when we multiply numbers only containing "1".</p>

    <p>Semordnilap (palindromes spelled backwards!) also called emordnilaps reveals different words when spelled backwards.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Live</b> ~ <b>Evil</b></li>
        <li><b>Diaper</b> ~ <b>Repaid</b></li>
        <li><b>Stressed</b> ~ <b>Desserts</b></li>
    </ul>

    <p>While still very interesting, palindromes in the english or any human language are less of a rule that predicts the occurance
        and instead a discriptive phenomenon that occurs by chance. When we move to the realm of mathmatics, we can actually find examples
        that we can predict. MOReEEREREREREEEereE say more about why math ones are cooler.
    </p>

    <p>As you may have already guessed, palindromic numbers are identified the same as explored above. <b>2718</b> and <b>8172</b> are both 
        palindromes of each other. While these numbers are not important in themselves (some of you may take offense to that but there is no
        decimal!), important numeric palindromes hold an interest in the recreational math community.
    </p>

    <p>multiply numbers of 1 to get palindromes. Add a norm distribution graph to show how it'
        weighted to the center. Explains why its a palindrome.
    </p>

    <p>Lychrel number</p>

    <p>Every positive integer can be written as the sum of three palindromic numbers in every number system with base 5 or greater.
        I NEED TO verify this and make sure its not same as lychrel num, tho i think its not
    </p>

    <p>Continued fraction</p>
